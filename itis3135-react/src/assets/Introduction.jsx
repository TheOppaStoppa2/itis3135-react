    <p>Hi, my name is Sankalp Kumar. I am a computer science major and I plan to graduate Spring 2027 (fingers crossed I did not mess up something). I enjoy playing basketball and scrolling on reels. My concentration is in data science. I love numbers and being able to combine it with my passion for computers, it's like peanut butter and jelly for me. I don’t know what else you guys need to know about me.</p>

Something really meaningful about the day ending and knowing it will happen again.</p>
