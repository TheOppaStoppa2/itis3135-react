      <h2>Course Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I, Sankalp Kumar, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025, ITIS3135, Web-Based Application Design 
        with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work I post publicly is accessible to the world, 
        and I will not post anything inappropriate. I understand that attendance is based on work submission, not logins. 
        I will use online resources only to learn and never copy from classmates without credit.
      </p>
      <p><em>Signed: Sankalp Kumar, 26/08/2025</em></p>
